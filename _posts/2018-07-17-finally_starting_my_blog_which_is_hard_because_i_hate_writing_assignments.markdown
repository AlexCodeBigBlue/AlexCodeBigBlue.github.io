Hello people of the internet.  My name is Alex, and I have decided to learn how to code.  I went to school at Johns Hopkins, where I only changed majors twice and thought I'd be happy working in research.  That ended up not being the case, and I took a job with the company my brother works for in online retail, to try to figure out what I *would* like to do for a living.  It took me a couple years, during which time I mainly learned that I was not a fan of working in online retail.  Many of my closest friends work in coding to one degree or another.  After talking with them about their jobs, the consesus was that they liked what they did and who they got to work with.  

I proceeded to try the Flatiron school free prep kit.  I found coding fit nicely into my personality in that I like getting blocks to build with and be creative.  Coding can be a bit of a puzzle, and sometimes frustrating in its required precision, but I prefer things that are precise, and as long as you understand them you can make almost anything you can imagine.

I love that coding gives you a litany of options, that there are so many places it can take you and you aren't limited to one small corner of the world.  I can't wait to see where it takes me.  Hopefully somewhere great to make up for my misery of being a Mets fan.
